> The Ambassadors


>  
> Comment: The Ambassadors is a 1903 novel by Henry James, originally published as a serial in the North American Review. The novel is a dark comedy which follows the trip of protagonist Lewis Lambert Strether to Paris, France to bring Chad Newsome, the son of his widowed fiancée, Mrs Newsome, back to the family business.

> a piece of literature is not necessarily violated if we give systematic attention to such matters as its author, its historical setting, and the formal properties of its language.  Practical Criticism, on the other hand, as it was developed at Cambridge by I. A. Richards, continues the tradition of the British Empiricists. Inductive rather than deductive, it makes a point of excluding linguistic and historical considerations, so as to derive—in appearance at least—all the literary values of a work empirically from the words on the page.

> Its air of objectivity confers a spurious authority on a process that is often only a rationalisation of an unexamined judgment, and that must always be to some extent subjective; its exclusion of historical factors seems to authorise a more general anti-historicism; and—though this objection is perhaps less generally accepted—it contains an inherent critical bias in the assumption that the part is a complete enough reflection of the literary whole to be profitably appreciated and discussed in isolation from its context


>  
> Comment: criticism of Practical Critisism which is that in excluding the external factors that make up a text, you are unable to holistically analyse the text




<br>

<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Important / Interesting</mark>
> Practical Criticism tends to find the most merit in the kind of writing which has virtues that are in some way separable from their larger context; it favours kinds of writing that are richly concrete in themselves, stylistically brilliant, or composed in relatively small units.





<br>

> better suited to verse than to prose; and better suited to certain kinds of either than to others where different and less concentrated merits are appropriate, as in the novel.


>  
> Comment: to me, due to the lack of content of the poem itself, it is all the more imperative to also consider the text as a whole, although, i do think that this is dependant on the authorial intent (nevertheless, regardless of authorial intent, one's writing does contain aspects of their current and present context)




<br>

<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Important / Interesting</mark>
> Practical Criticism surely tends to sensitise us towards objects only within a certain range of magnitude: below that threshold it becomes subjective and impressionist, paying very little attention to the humble facts of the grammar and syntax of the words on the page; while, at the other extreme, it often ignores the larger meaning, and the literary and historical contexts of that meaning.

> Strether's first question, when he reached the hotel, was about his friend; yet on his learning that Waymarsh was apparently not to arrive till evening he was not wholly disconcerted. A telegram from him bespeaking a room 'only 5 if not noisy', reply paid, was produced for the inquirer at the office, so that the understanding they should meet at Chester rather than at Liverpool remained to that extent sound. The same secret principle, however, that had prompted Strether not absolutely to desire Waymarsh's 10 presence at the dock, that had led him thus to postpone for a few hours his enjoyment of it, now operated to make him feel he could still wait without disappointment. They would dine together at the worst, and, with all respect to dear old Waymarsh—if not even, for that matter, to him15 self—there was little fear that in the sequel they shouldn't see enough of each other. The principle I have just mentioned as operating had been, with the most newly disembarked of the two men, wholly instinctive—the fruit of a sharp sense that, delightful as it would be to find him20 self looking, after so much separation, into his comrade's face, his business would be a trifle bungled should he simply arrange for this countenance to present itself to the nearing steamer as the first 'note' of Europe. Mixed with everything was the apprehension, already, on Strether's 25 part, that it would, at best, throughout, prove the note of Europe in quite a sufficient degree.8

> a preference for non-transitive verbs; many abstract nouns; much use of 'that'; a certain amount of elegant variation to avoid piling up personal pronouns and adjectives such as 'he', 'his' and 'him'; and the presence of a great many negatives and near-negatives.

> James's late prose style is characteristically abstract; more explicitly, that the main grammatical subjects are very often nouns for mental ideas, 'question', 'principle', etc.; and that the verbs—because they are mainly used either non-transitively, or in infinitive, participial and gcrundial forms,—tend to express states of being rather than particular finite actions affecting objects.


>  
> Comment: technique here is the use of abstract nouns as well as non-transitive verbs. effect is to create a prose style that is abstract in nature
> nouns are mainly mental ideas - 'question'; 'principle'
> 
> verb - used
> - non-transitively (no object);
> - in infinitive (is, am, was);
> - participial (a verb form that functions as an adjective or adverb; -ing present participle (am running) /past participle (has finished)); or
> 
> - gerundial ( verb ending in "-ing" that functions as a noun within a sentence; i love _swimming_)

<br>

<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Important / Interesting</mark>
> instead of a sheer stated event, we get a very special view of it; the mere fact that actuality has been digested into reported speech—the question 'was about his friend'—involves a narrator to do the job, to interpret the action, and also a presumed audience that he does it for: and by implication, the heat of the action itself must have cooled off somewhat for the translation and analysis of the events into this form of statement to have had time to occur.


>  
> Comment: instead of just narrating the event itself, james' style allows us a unique perspective into it,
> if the text was reported, it would not be of Strether's accord, but that it would be of the narator who not only tells of the story, but in doing so, has to interpret it FOR an audience that he presumes will be listening
> 
> and at the same time, by reporting the speech verbatim, it signifies that it has past.




<br>

<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Important / Interesting</mark>
> making the subject of the sentence 'question' rather than 'he', has the effect of subordinating the particular actor, and therefore the particular act, to a much more general perspective: mental rather than physical, and subjective rather than objective


>  
> Comment: Looking at the syntax of the sentence - subject is question - which generalises BOTH the actor and the act of questioning




<br>

<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Important / Interesting</mark>
> disliked the 'mere platitude of statement' involved in first-person narrative; partly, presumably, because it would merge Strether's consciousness into the narrative, and not isolate it for the reader's inspection. For such isolation, a more expository method is needed: no confusion of subject and object, as in first-person narration, but a narrator forcing the reader to pay attention to James's primary objective—Strether's mental and subjective state.


>  
> Comment: by merely stating what had happened, we get explicit insight into Strether's "consciousness", which "merges it into the narrative", preventing further analysis into the subject
> 
> but by making things more general, James' forces the reader to pay attention to his consciousness




<br>

<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Important / Interesting</mark>
> here are always at least three levels of development—all of them subjective: the characters' awareness of events: the narrator's seeing of them; and our own trailing perception of the relation between these two.





<br>

<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Important / Interesting</mark>
> primary location of the narrative in a mental rather than a physical continuum gives the narrative a great freedom from the restrictions of particular time and place.





<br>

<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Important / Interesting</mark>
> such transitions of time and place are much easier to effect when the main subjects of the sentences are abstract: a 'principle' exists independently of its context.
