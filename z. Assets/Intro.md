- **<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Red</mark>** : Disagree
	- is for claims the author makes that I disagree with, am skeptical of, or know has been debunked in some way by other studies
- **<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Yellow</mark>**: Important / Interesting
	- is for important or interesting claims made by the author, so ideas that are important for their main thesis that I want to remember or include in a summary I write
- **<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Green</mark>**: Agree
	- is for claims the author makes that I agree with and that are relevant to work I’m doing, so these are usually quotes I will directly include in my own work. I tend to use this color more conservatively, so yellow is probably my most-used color.
- **<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Purple</mark>**: Chapter/Section
	- to highlight every single chapter or section heading because when I export the annotations, it’s helpful to have some kind of outline to keep the context around for direct quotes and things.
- **<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Blue</mark>**: Related Sources
	- is for claims that the author cites from other sources or claims they make that connects to ideas from another author. I pretty much always use blue highlights with a comment (which you can add comments directly to highlights in Zotero) to tell me, “Oh this connects to this other author or look up this source later.”
- **<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Pink</mark>**: ??Confused
	- /Magenta is my confused color. Either I have no idea what the author is saying or I have questions that haven’t been answered that may come up later, and I want a reminder for in case it doesn’t get answered. If there is an answer later, I comment or highlight that in pink as well and comment that it was my question from whatever page.
- **<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Orange</mark>**: Definition
	- is my definition color. Whenever an author defines anything important, I highlight it in orange, which is helpful for lit reviews because then I can look at how different authors are defining the same term. But it’s also helpful for normal learning and making flashcards because easily scan and find the terms I want to make flashcards for.
