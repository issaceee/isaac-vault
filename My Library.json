  {"id":"arnoldCultureAnarchyEssay1869","abstract":"By the middle of the nineteenth century, culture was often considered to be nothing but a meaningless 'smattering of Latin and Greek'. In this work, first published in 1869, Matthew Arnold (1822–88) redefines culture as a striving for 'the best that has been thought or said', and as a contrast to 'philistinism' and the over-valuation of the practical. Critical of the uninspiring lifestyles of many of his religious and non-religious contemporaries, he raises the controversial issue of how to lead a good life, aesthetically, intellectually and morally. He introduces a middle road between classical and Judaeo-Christian ideals ('Hellenism' and 'Hebraism') which promotes the state over the individual, a position that has often prompted his critics to consider him an authoritarian thinker. A fascinating piece of social and political criticism, and an adjunct to Arnold's poetry, this work was both controversial when it was first published, and enormously influential thereafter","author":[{"family":"Arnold","given":"Matthew"}],"citation-key":"arnoldCultureAnarchyEssay1869","collection-title":"Cambridge library collection.

First published in 1903, The Ambassadors follows the middle-aged Lambert Strether, dispatched from Massachusetts to Paris by his wealthy fiancee to \"rescue\" her son Chad from the corrupting influences of Europe and its wicked women. Once Strether arrives in Paris, however, Chad introduces him to a world that he finds refined and sophisticated, rather than debauched and base. He is especially enchanted by Chad's female companions, Madame de Vionnet and her daughter, Jeanne, and begins to wonder if, all his life, he has missed out on what the wider world has to offer. As his fiancee, waiting in Massachusetts, grows impatient, she sends more ambassadors to retrieve her wayward men.
