Vargish, Thomas. _REVENGE AND “[[WUTHERING HEIGHTS]].”_ n.d.



# Summary

In this paper, Vargish attempts to answer the question " What significance should we attach to the brutal deprivation and degradation Heathcliff inflicts upon Isabella and the three children of the second generation, Hareton, Linton, and Cathy? What, in relation to his love for the first Catherine, is the meaning of his revenge?". These questions arise from the idea that Heathcliff manipulates the 2nd generation, in an attempt to structure existence by means of a single impulse, that of revenge. That in his policy, practice and eventual transcendence of the two, Brontë reveals "a depth, an aesthetic value, which lifts it above the stock motive or the psychological convention it appears to be in"
