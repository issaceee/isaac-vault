# Summary

"the mode of narration used in [[Wuthering Heights]]- a series of narratorial frames that both reinforce and undercut one another- is both a showcase for and a critique of two major modes of narrative authority current in the nineteenth-century British novel: [[the gothic]] and [[the domestic]]. It's possible to learn a great deal about the expectations placed on narration in nineteenth-century novels from Wuthering Heights, a novel that makes its central concern an illustration of [[narratorial failure]] and [[narrative inadequacy]]. It does so, I contend, by conscientiously identifying and discarding the methods used by earlier novels to construct [[narrative authority]]."

Wuthering Heights act as an attack on the narrative traditions of the 19th century, mainly through its use of [[narratorial frames]] that at once reinforce and subvert each other - that is, the use of narration in WH allows for...

"Wuthering Heights demonstrates perhaps more clearly than any other nineteenth-century novel the ways in which literary history participates in novelistic discourse, and its discomfort with the awareness that novels could also address literary history. The ways in which the critical discourse surrounding Wuthering Heights replicates the gothic structure of the novel indicates the degree of literary history's indebtedness to the novels it describes, while the general neglect of Wuthering Heights in nineteenth-century histories of the novel hints at the degree to which Wuthering Heights undercuts the progressive narrative so central to the history of the novel. By revealing that the efforts of the domestic to separate itself from the gothic result in a replication of [[gothic violence]], Wuthering Heights attacked the fundamental premises of the narrative of [[the rise of the novel]]."

# Key Points

- Narrators themselves "who are by and large completely unsympathetic to, and often disapproving of, the stories they tell."
- "no authoritative narrator in Wuthering Heights; the novel is not simply incoherent, but rather refuses to cohere."

"gothic is marked by a proliferation of narrative frames and voices, and represents the forces of violence, wildness and savagery, as opposed to the domestic, which is marked by an assumption of omniscient, totalizing narratorial awareness and associated with civilization, cultivation, and the feminine"
- A clear binary is drawn between the narrative frames of The Gothic and The Domestic. However Rena-Sozier argues that WH subverts this opposition
	- The Gothic is at once limited and wild, reminiscient of the psychoanalytic "id"
	- In comparison, the Domestic acts as the typical narrative, omniscient, civilised, omnipresent - it is the psychoanlytic "ego"


"the [[domestic]] is predicated on acts of violence"


"Wuthering Heights was so disturbing to the discipline of literary history that the novel could only be dealt with in disguise as a biographical anecdote."
- Rena-Dozier references the anecdote about Emily Brontë in Gaskell's [[Life of Charlotte Brontë]] in which she brutally beats her dog.
- This anecdote is reminiscent of the structure and themes of WH (!!how so) --> contradictory narratives
