# Introduction

closeness of themes to Dickens' *Hard Times* - "industrial conditions as a matrix for personal relations"
- Dickens' - a moral fable presented in an uneasy mixture of realistic and emblematic characters and situations
- Gaskell's - a human **comedy** traced through consistent and developing characters set in conditions the **author understood from long personal experience**

Similarity - "Dickens had stressed the individual in hard Times, a moral fable which is often angularly schematic, often confused, and finally inadequate in offering the fun and games of Sleary's circus as a pancea for societys ills, yet where the pressure of institutions and the danger of the cash-nexus are clearly stated.... (Gaskell) exploration of an awakened consciousness receptive to environment"

"both writers show skill in presenting a young girl who must deal virtually unassisted with the unklwon"

Gaskell: "I dare say I shall like my story, when I am a little further from itl at present I can only feel depressed about it, I meant it to have been so much better" --> authorial distance


**Serialisation vs the Novel**
- How does this affect the message being told to the readers (on the writer's end?)
- How does this affect how the message is being read by the readers?
- Why exactly did Gaskell feel that such a format didn't allow for her story to be told faithfully
