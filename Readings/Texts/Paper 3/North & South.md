# Introduction

closeness of themes to Dickens' *Hard Times* - "industrial conditions as a matrix for personal relations"
- Dickens' - a moral fable presented in an uneasy mixture of realistic and emblematic characters and situations
- Gaskell's - a human **comedy** traced through consistent and developing characters set in conditions the **author understood from long personal experience**

Similarity - "Dickens had stressed the individual in hard Times, a moral fable which is often angularly schematic, often confused, and finally inadequate in offering the fun and games of Sleary's circus as a pancea for societys ills, yet where the pressure of institutions and the danger of the cash-nexus are clearly stated.... (Gaskell) exploration of an awakened consciousness receptive to environment"

"both writers show skill in presenting a young girl who must deal virtually unassisted with the unklwon"

Gaskell: "I dare say I shall like my story, when I am a little further from itl at present I can only feel depressed about it, I meant it to have been so much better" --> authorial distance


**Serialisation vs the Novel**
- How does this affect the message being told to the readers (on the writer's end?)
- How does this affect how the message is being read by the readers?
- Why exactly did Gaskell feel that such a format didn't allow for her story to be told faithfully


# Thoughts

- Perspective & Truth
	- The masters and the hands each have their own perspective of what is right and wrong, whether or not both are true
	- The Hales, as an outsider are in a privileged position of being a mediator between the two truths here, but this is only because they are outsiders
		- yet, because of being outsiders, the truth of some situations are also inaccessible to the Hales (they cannot relate to the plights of either)
		- yet, they also CAN relate to both
			- // bessy and Mrs Hale: in terms of being sick/being affected by the working conditions
			- // bessy and Margaret: in terms of being young teenage girls that are religious and trying to navigate
			- Margaret vs Edith (Margaret's could have been if she went with lennox?)
	- I think it'll also be interesting to consider the idea of religion here (one singular truth)
		- I think gaskell sets up a little bit of foreshadowing in highlighting first the father's struggle with the church and their one singular ideology, and this sets the precursor/context for the entire story and sturggle
		- There's also a lot of references/allusions within the story itself, i think it is an attempt to lend credibility to certain perspectives and truths, yet at the same time there is always other allusions to various other truths that call into question other truths

- "They were to hou'd together through thick and thinl what the major part thought, t'others

### ch. 7


### ch. 8
- "No: because they can't control themselves. WOmen of our class don't go, because they have no power over their emotions, and yet are ashamed of showing them.

- "that the last visible token of the presence of his wife was to be carried away from him, and hidden from his sight"

### ch. 9
- "There was something of infignation expressed in her countenance, but so kept down and controlled, that it gave her a superb air of disdain. There was no surprise, no curiosity. She stood awaiting the opening of his business there. Not a question did she ask."

- "if he had but foreseen that she would have stained her whiteness by a falsefood"

- "Mr Thornton, above all people, on whjome she had looked down from her imaginary heights till now! She suddenly found herself at his feet and was strangely distressed at her fall."

- "Not humbled before God, as having failed in trust towards Him; not degraded and abased in Mr Thornton's sight" - "here was she calssing his low opinion of her alonside with the displeasure of God"
- "She believed that she could have borne the sense of Almighty displeasure, because He knew all, and could read her penitence, and hear her cries for help in time to come. But Mr. Thornton– why did she tremble, and hide her face in the pillow?"

- "she was not good enough, nor pure enough to be indifferent to the lowered opinion of a fellow creature;that the thought of how he must be looking upon her with contempt, stoood between her and her sense of wrong-doing"

- "Fomerly, Margaret would have come to him as priest as well as father, to tell him of her temptations nad her sin; but latterly they had not spoken much on such subjectsl and she knew not how, in his change of opinions, he would reply if the depth of her soul called unto his"

- "By-and-by they'll find out, tyrants makes liars."
- "But once i' the Union, his interests are taken care on better nor he could do it for himsel' or by himsel'... it puts a bit of a check on him, whether he likes it or no"

	- not quotation - part of narrative

- "I will go,' said she."

- the entire sequence of events is meant to question Nicholas Higgin's undying loyalty to the Union. Union --> ostracized Boucher --> Boucher cannot find work --> kill himself

### ch. 12
- "Margaret's heart bled.... It was intermingling the coarsness of horror with the profoundness of natural grief."
- "She could not enter into the enduring mercy of the God who had not specially interposed to prevent the water from drowning her prostrate husband"
- "The masters... the union... the children... all made up one great army of personal enemies, whose fault it was that she was now a helpless widow"

- "it is the town life... their nevers .... and in the country some get such stagnant habits of mind that they are almost fatalists" - this entire dialogue and excahgne is interesting - i think it captures the heart of the novel

- "Of all faults the one she most despised in others was the want of bravery; the meanness of heart which leads to untruth"

- "Why master and you must always be asking the lower classes up-stairs, since we came to Milton, I cannot understand. Fold at Helstone were never brought higher than the kitchen; and I've let one or two fo them know before now that they might think it an honour to be even there"

- "I've been a seeking work. I have.... I said to mysel', I'd keep a civil tongue in my head, let who would say what 'em would. I'd set my teeth into my tongue sooner nor speak i' haste"
- "I would ha guided Boucher to a better end: but I set him off o' th' road, and so I mun answer for him"

- "Meddling 'twixt master and man is liker meddling 'twixt husband and wife than aught else"
- "It's amusing to see how he evidently respects the part in Mr Thornton's character which is like his own"
- "if he and Mr Thornton would speak out together as man to man–if Higgins would forget that Mr. Thornton was a master, and speak to him as he does to us– and if Mr. Thornton would be patient enough to listen to him with his human heart, not with his master's ears"

### ch. 13
-
