# Introduction

closeness of themes to Dickens' *Hard Times* - "industrial conditions as a matrix for personal relations"
- Dickens' - a moral fable presented in an uneasy mixture of realistic and emblematic characters and situations
- Gaskell's - a human **comedy** traced through consistent and developing characters set in conditions the **author understood from long personal experience**

Similarity - "Dickens had stressed the individual in hard Times, a moral fable which is often angularly schematic, often confused, and finally inadequate in offering the fun and games of Sleary's circus as a pancea for societys ills, yet where the pressure of institutions and the danger of the cash-nexus are clearly stated.... (Gaskell) exploration of an awakened consciousness receptive to environment"

"both writers show skill in presenting a young girl who must deal virtually unassisted with the unklwon"

Gaskell: "I dare say I shall like my story, when I am a little further from itl at present I can only feel depressed about it, I meant it to have been so much better" --> authorial distance


**Serialisation vs the Novel**
- How does this affect the message being told to the readers (on the writer's end?)
- How does this affect how the message is being read by the readers?
- Why exactly did Gaskell feel that such a format didn't allow for her story to be told faithfully

- MRs Shaw wants Edith to marry for love yet "Mrs Shaw enjoyed the romance of the present engagement rather more than her daughter"
- "It is possible she might have had little qualms of ill-concealed regret that Captain Lennox could not have united in his person everything that was desirable. In this she was but her mother's child"
- "there are forms and ceremonies to be gone through, not so much to satisfy oneself, as to stop the world's mouht, without which stoppage there would be very little satisfaction in life"

ch. 2
- Mrs Hale :"as he had not the money to equip his wife afresh, from top to toe, she would not show herself at her only sister's only wedding"
- Margaret: "She took a pride in her forest. Its people were her people. She made hearty friends with theml learned and delighted in using their peculiar words; took up her freedom amongst theml nursed their babiesl t..."
