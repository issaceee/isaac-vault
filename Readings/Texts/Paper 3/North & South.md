# Introduction

closeness of themes to Dickens' *Hard Times* - "industrial conditions as a matrix for personal relations"
- Dickens' - a moral fable presented in an uneasy mixture of realistic and emblematic characters and situations
- Gaskell's - a human **comedy** traced through consistent and developing characters set in conditions the **author understood from long personal experience**

Similarity - "Dickens had stressed the individual in hard Times, a moral fable which is often angularly schematic, often confused, and finally inadequate in offering the fun and games of Sleary's circus as a pancea for societys ills, yet where the pressure of institutions and the danger of the cash-nexus are clearly stated.... (Gaskell) exploration of an awakened consciousness receptive to environment"

"both writers show skill in presenting a young girl who must deal virtually unassisted with the unklwon"

Gaskell: "I dare say I shall like my story, when I am a little further from itl at present I can only feel depressed about it, I meant it to have been so much better" --> authorial distance


**Serialisation vs the Novel**
- How does this affect the message being told to the readers (on the writer's end?)
- How does this affect how the message is being read by the readers?
- Why exactly did Gaskell feel that such a format didn't allow for her story to be told faithfully


# Key Points

- characterisation of mrs hale.

ch. 6

	- a very strong juxtaposition is drawn between religion vs non // countryside vs industrialisation

ch. 7
- "everything looked more purposelike"
- "She had never come fairly in contact with .... which are of themselves the framework of elegance"
- "a young lady of a different type to most... her dress was very plain... and which she wore as an empress wears her drapery"

- "most of the manufacturers polaced.... unsparingly cutting away all off-shoots in the direction of literature or high mental cultiuvation, in hopes of throwing the whole strength and vigour of the plant into commerce"
- "the power of the machinery of milton, the power of the men of milton, impressed him with a sense ofgrandeur... she was thrown with one or two of those who, in all measures affecting masses of people, must be acute sufferes for the good of many. The question always is, has everything been done to make the sufferings of these exceptions as small as possible? Or, in the triumph of the crowded procession, have the helpless been trampled on, instead of being gently lifted aside out of the roadway of the conqueror, whom they have no power to accompany on his march"
- "endure the rough independent way in which all the Milton girls... even went the lenght of questioning...having doubts and fears oftheir own"

- "They came rushing along... not unfriendly freedom"
- "simple reliance opn her womanly sympathy with their love of dress"

- "ANd yetyo see North and South has both met and made kind o friends in this big smoky place" - Milton as a place where people gather - pros of industrialisation?
