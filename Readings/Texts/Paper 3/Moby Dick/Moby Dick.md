# Key Qoutes

## ch. 1

- (62) "having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore"
- (62) "Right and left, the streets take you waterward" , (62) "If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me", (63) "Let the most absent.... region"
	- sense of inevitability
- "meditation and water are wedded for ever"

- (65) "No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor"
- (65) "everybody else is one way or other served in much the same way–either in a physical or metaphysical point of view, that is; and so the universal thump is passed roumd, and all hands should rub each other's shoulder-blades and be content"

- "the great flood-gates of the wonder-world squng open, and in the wild conceits that swayed me to my purpose, two and two.... like a snow hill in the air"

## ch. 2
- "Nantucket was her great original–the Tyre of this Carthage;–the place where the first dead American whale was stranded"

- "the great Black Paarliament sitting in Tophet. A hundred black faces turned round in their rows to peer; and beyond, a black Angel of Doom was beating a book in a pulpit... blackness of darkness, and the weeping and wailing and teeth-gnashing there."

- "Euroclydon, nevertheless, is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in-doors, with his feet on the hob quietly toasting for bed.... it maketh a marvellous difference, whether thou lookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the outside, or whether thou observest it from that sashless window, whether the frost is on both sides, and of which the wight Death is the only glazier"
	- outside - readers?


- "we are going a-whaling..."
	- use of "we"

## ch. 3
- "you found youself..."
	- use of 2nd person pronouns // 

- "THe picture represents a Cape-Horner in a great hurricane; the half-foundered ship weltering there with its three dismantled masts alone visible; and an exasperated whale, purposing to spring clean over the craft, is in the enormous act of impaling himself upon the three mast-heads" 

- "(though but a sleeping-partner one, so far as this narrative is concered)"

- "he bought up a lot of 'balmed New Zealand heads (great curios, you know)"

- "a man can be honest in any sort of skin"

- ritual done by the harpooner to the idol
	- “laying a bit of ship biscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the shavings into a sacrificial blaze. Presently, after many hasty snatches into the fire, and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers (whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly), he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit; then blowing off the heat and ashes a little, he made a polite offer of it to the little negro. ”

- “I turned in, and never slept better in my life.”

## ch. 4

- “anything indeed but condemning me to lie abed such an unendurable length of time.”
	- foreshadowing to doing nth on the ocean and seeing nothing??


- “ I felt a shock running through all my frame; nothing was to be seen, and nothing was to be heard; but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine.”
- “Queequeg, do you see, was a creature in the transition stage—neither caterpillar nor butterfly. He was just enough civilized to show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manner. ”

## ch. 5
- “men who have seen the world, thereby become quite at ease in manner, quite self-possessed in company. ”

- “ I was preparing to hear some good stories about whaling; to my no small surprise nearly every man maintained a profound silence. And not only that, but they looked embarrassed.”

## ch. 6
- “But, besides the Feegeeans, Tongatobooarrs, Erromanggoans, Pannangians, and Brighggians, and, besides the wild specimens of the whaling-craft which unheeded reel about the streets, you will see other sights still more curious, certainly more comical. There weekly arrive in this town scores of green Vermonters and New Hampshire men, all athirst for gain and glory in the fishery.”

- “so omnipotent is art; which in many a district of New Bedford has superinduced bright terraces of flowers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown aside at creation’s final day.”
	- “You must go to New Bedford to see a brilliant wedding; for, they say, they have reservoirs of oil in every house, and every night recklessly burn their lengths in spermaceti candles.”
	- the pleasures of the town are made possible with the whaling/fishing buysinesses

## ch. 7
- “Each silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart from the other, as if each silent grief were insular and incommunicable. The chaplain had not yet arrived; and there these silent islands of men and women sat steadfastly eyeing several marble tablets, with black borders, masoned into the wall on either side the pulpit”
	- Foreshadowing to death

- “Oh! ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass; who standing among flowers can say—here, here lies my beloved; ye know not the desolation that broods in bosoms like these. What bitter blanks in those black-bordered marbles which cover no ashes! What despair in those immovable inscriptions! What deadly voids and unbidden infidelities in the lines that seem to gnaw upon all Faith, and refuse resurrections to the beings who have placelessly perished without a grave”
	- death in the sea --> without a grave, forever lost/wandering, no relief to the surviving family and friends --> elevates the danger

- “But Faith, like a jackal, feeds among the tombs, and even from these dead doubts she gathers her most vital hope.”

- “Yes, there is death in this business of whaling—a speechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into Eternity. But what then? Methinks we have hugely mistaken this matter of Life and Death. Methinks that what they call my shadow here on earth is my true substance. Methinks that in looking at things spiritual, we are too much like oysters observing the sun through the water, and thinking that thick water the thinnest of air. Methinks my body is but the lees of my better being. In fact take my body who will, take it I say, it is not me.”

## ch. 8

- “At the time I now write of”
	- Again, this narrative distance/technique

- “finished the pulpit without a stairs, substituting a perpendicular side ladder, like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea.”
- “Father Mapple cast a look upwards, and then with a truly sailor-like but still reverential dexterity, hand over hand, mounted the steps as if ascending the main-top of his vessel.”
- “deliberately drag up the ladder step by step, till the whole was deposited within, leaving him impregnable in his little Quebec.”
	- “Can it be, then, that by that act of physical isolation, he signifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time, from all outward worldly ties and connexions? Yes, for replenished with the meat and wine of the world, to the faithful man of God, this pulpit, I see, is a self-containing stronghold—a lofty Ehrenbreitstein,* with a perennial well of water within the walls.”
- “the world’s a ship on its passage out, and not a voyage complete; and the pulpit is its prow”

### ch. 9
- “offered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying at the bottom of the sea.”
- “if we obey God, we must disobey ourselves; and it is in this disobeying ourselves, wherein the hardness of obeying God consists.”
- “He thinks that a ship made by men, will carry him into countries where God does not reign, but only the Captains of this earth.”
	- one cannot escape fate/destiny
- “For sinful as he is, Jonah does not weep and wail for direct deliverance. He feels that his dreadful punishment is just. He leaves all his deliverance to God, contenting himself with this, that spite of all his pains and pangs, he will still look towards His holy temple. And here, shipmates, is true and faithful repentance; not clamorous for pardon, but grateful for punishment.”

## ch. 10
- “You cannot hide the soul. Through all his unearthly tattooings, I thought I saw the traces of a simple honest heart; and in his large, deep eyes, fiery black and bold, there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare a thousand devils. ”
