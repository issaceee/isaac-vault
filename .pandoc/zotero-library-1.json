By revealing that the efforts of the domestic to separate itself from the gothic result in a replication of gothic violence, Wuthering Heights attacked the fundamental premises of the narrative of the rise of the novel, disturbing the progressive logic of the history of the novel by demonstrating the interdependence, and ultimate indistinguishability, of gothic and domestic modes. In so doing, Wuthering Heights became a deeply uncomfortable text for nineteenth-century literary history, so uncomfortable that it remained marginal for nearly a century after its publication.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",8,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Rena-Dozier","given":"Emily"}],"citation-key":"rena-dozierGothicCriticismsWuthering2010","container-title":"ELH","container-title-short":"elh","DOI":"10.1353/elh.2010.0000","ISSN":"1080-6547","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",9]]},"language":"en","page":"757-775","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Gothic Criticisms: Wuthering Heights and Nineteenth-Century Literary History","title-short":"Gothic Criticisms","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://muse.jhu.edu/article/399532","volume":"77"},{"id":"shapiroWUTHERINGHEIGHTSVICTORIAN","author":[{"family":"Shapiro","given":"Arnold"}],"citation-key":"shapiroWUTHERINGHEIGHTSVICTORIAN","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"\"WUTHERING HEIGHTS\" AS A VICTORIAN NOVEL","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"stonemanFeministCriticismWuthering2025","author":[{"family":"Stoneman","given":"Patsy"}],"citation-key":"stonemanFeministCriticismWuthering2025","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Feminist criticism of \"Wuthering Heights\"","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"UnreliableNarratorWuthering","citation-key":"UnreliableNarratorWuthering","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"The Unreliable Narrator in Wuthering Heights","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"vargishREVENGEWUTHERINGHEIGHTS","author":[{"family":"Vargish","given":"Thomas"}],"citation-key":"vargishREVENGEWUTHERINGHEIGHTS","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"REVENGE AND \"WUTHERING HEIGHTS\"","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"VillainWutheringHeights","citation-key":"VillainWutheringHeights","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"The Villain in Wuthering Heights","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"wattFirstParagraphAmbassadors1960","type":"article-journal","container-title":"Essays in Criticism","DOI":"10.1093/eic/X.3.250","ISSN":"0014-0856, 1471-6852","issue":"3","journalAbbreviation":"Essays in Criticism","language":"en","page":"250-274","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The First Paragraph of <i>The Ambassadors</i> : An Explication","title-short":"The First Paragraph of <i>The Ambassadors</i>","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/eic/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eic/X.3.250","volume":"X","author":[{"family":"Watt","given":"Ian"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",9,6]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["1960"]]},"citation-key":"wattFirstParagraphAmbassadors1960","library":"My Library","citekey":"wattFirstParagraphAmbassadors1960"},{"id":"williamsNaturalSupernaturalismWuthering","author":[{"family":"Williams","given":"Anne"}],"citation-key":"williamsNaturalSupernaturalismWuthering","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Natural Supernaturalism in \"Wuthering Heights\"","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"WutheringHeights","citation-key":"WutheringHeights","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Wuthering Heights","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"WutheringHeightsCritics","citation-key":"WutheringHeightsCritics","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"\"Wuthering Heights\" and the Critics","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"jamesAmbassadors2016","type":"book","abstract":"\"One of the great masterpieces of James's late period--and the author's own favorite among his works. EVERYMAN'S LIBRARY. First published in 1903, The Ambassadors follows the middle-aged Lambert Strether, dispatched from Massachusetts to Paris by his wealthy fiancee to \"rescue\" her son Chad from the corrupting influences of Europe and its wicked women. Once Strether arrives in Paris, however, Chad introduces him to a world that he finds refined and sophisticated, rather than debauched and base. He is especially enchanted by Chad's female companions, Madame de Vionnet and her daughter, Jeanne, and begins to wonder if, all his life, he has missed out on what the wider world has to offer. As his fiancee, waiting in Massachusetts, grows impatient, she sends more ambassadors to retrieve her wayward men.
